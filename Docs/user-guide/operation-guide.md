# Operation Guide

This guide explains JUMBLEQ's physical controls, audio routing, USB signal routing, DVS operation, and OLED indications.

## Signal Routing Overview

Audio sources are assigned to Channel Faders A and B using [JUMBLEQ Configurator](./configurator.md). In standard operation, the Channel Fader A signal is sent to USB 1/2 and the Channel Fader B signal is sent to USB 3/4. Either USB pair can be selected as a Return source and mixed with its corresponding channel-fader signal.

See the [Signal Flow reference](../reference/signal-flow.md) for the detailed audio-routing diagram.

## USB Signal Routing

DVS can be enabled independently for Input Ch. 1 and Input Ch. 2 using [JUMBLEQ Configurator](./configurator.md). The DVS state changes the USB Send source as follows:

| DVS state | Send source | Destination |
|---|---|---|
| Disabled | Channel Fader A (post-fader) | USB 1/2 |
| Disabled | Channel Fader B (post-fader) | USB 3/4 |
| Input Ch. 1 enabled | Input Ch. 1 (pre-fader) | USB 1/2 |
| Input Ch. 2 enabled | Input Ch. 2 (pre-fader) | USB 3/4 |

### When DVS Is Disabled

When DVS is disabled for a USB pair, its corresponding channel-fader signal is sent to the connected USB host as shown in the table above. The Return source can be set to any USB pair whose corresponding DVS setting is disabled, or to None:

| Return setting | Wet signal | Dry signal |
|---|---|---|
| USB 1/2 | USB 1/2 | Channel Fader A (post-fader) |
| USB 3/4 | USB 3/4 | Channel Fader B (post-fader) |
| None | Muted | Channel Faders A and B remain fully dry |

The Dry/Wet knob crossfades the selected Wet signal against its corresponding Dry signal. At 0% the selected path is fully dry; at 100% it is fully wet. The Return knob adjusts the level of the selected Wet signal.

When Return is set to None, Dry is fixed at 100% and Wet at 0%. The Dry/Wet and Return knobs therefore have no effect.

### When DVS Is Enabled

The USB pair corresponding to the enabled DVS channel is used for the DVS send and return path instead of the standard channel-fader Send and selectable Return path. JUMBLEQ Configurator prevents that USB pair from being selected as the Return source.

The Dry/Wet and Return knobs do not control the DVS path. If the other USB pair is not reserved by DVS and is selected as the Return source, both knobs continue to control that Return path normally.

## Knob Assignments

The following diagram shows the current knob assignments.

## Magnetic-switch Assignments

The switches labeled `fade` provide behavior similar to the channel faders on a conventional DJ mixer. Instead of moving a physical fader, key travel changes a virtual fader position according to the current [fader curve setting](#fader-curve-settings). The A fade switches control Channel Fader A, and the B fade switches control Channel Fader B.

The following diagram shows the current magnetic-switch assignments.

### Magnetic-switch Functions

| Panel label | Function |
|---|---|
| A (B) fade down | Controls Channel Fader A (B) in the normal or reverse direction depending on whether the corresponding fade-up switch is held. See [Fade-down Direction](#fade-down-direction). |
| A (B) fade up | Moves Channel Fader A (B) from its current position toward full level. The response follows the corresponding channel-fader curve setting. |
| Aux. A/B (B/A) fade down | Provides an additional fade-down control assignable to Channel Fader A or B using JUMBLEQ Configurator. It follows the same direction behavior as the assigned fader's fade-down switch. See [Auxiliary Fade-down Switches](#auxiliary-fade-down-switches). |
| MIDI CC / Note (4 switches) | Sends MIDI CC 12–15 or Notes 68–71 on MIDI Ch. 1 with a linear response to key travel. The output mode is selected using JUMBLEQ Configurator. |

### Auxiliary Fade-down Switches

<img width="480" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2f6f36c-b0cb-4ead-a585-a3e3bf55507e" />

The two auxiliary fade-down switches can each be assigned to Channel Fader A or B using JUMBLEQ Configurator. By assigning both auxiliary switches to the same Channel Fader, that fader can be operated with up to three fade-down switches: its main fade-down switch plus the two auxiliary switches.

This arrangement makes rapid multi-click patterns easier to perform, including scratch techniques such as 3-click flares and crab scratches. By default, the A/B auxiliary switch is assigned to Channel Fader A, and the B/A auxiliary switch is assigned to Channel Fader B.

### Fader Curve Settings

The fader curve determines how the key travel of a fade switch is converted to the virtual fader position. Channel Faders A and B can be configured independently using JUMBLEQ Configurator.

| Setting | Response | Style |
|---|---|---|
| 0% | Widest and most gradual response across the key travel. | Mixing |
| 100% | Narrowest response and sharpest cut. | Scratching |

Intermediate settings progressively change the response between these two extremes. The corresponding curve applies to the fade-up and fade-down switches, including any auxiliary fade-down switch assigned to that Channel Fader.

### Fade-down Direction

The A and B fade-down switches change direction depending on whether the matching fade-up switch is held:

| Matching fade-up switch | Pressing fade down | Releasing fade down | Typical use |
|---|---|---|---|
| Not held | Moves the fader toward full level after soft takeover. | Returns the fader to mute after takeover. | Momentary fade-in |
| Held | Moves the fader toward mute. | Restores the level set by the held fade-up switch. | Momentary cut |

When fade up is not held, the fade-down switch uses reversed key travel: its released position represents mute, and pressing it deeper represents a higher level. Soft takeover prevents a sudden level jump by waiting until this reversed value reaches the current fader level before the switch takes control.

This behavior applies independently to Channel Faders A and B. An auxiliary fade-down switch follows the same behavior as the fader to which it is assigned.

See the [MIDI Transmit Specification](../reference/midi/transmit.md) for the MIDI output from all magnetic sensors.

## OLED Indications

The main OLED shows the current sample rate, input and output gains, Return status, and headphone level. The Return indication changes with the selected source:

| Return setting | OLED source indication |
|---|---|
| USB 1/2 | `RTN\|U12` |
| USB 3/4 | `RTN\|U34` |
| None | `RTN\|OFF` |

When USB 1/2 or USB 3/4 is selected, the Return gain is shown after the source indication. When Return is set to None, the gain field shows `---`.

The sub OLED shows the sources assigned to Channel Faders A and B, their input types and DVS states, the post-fader source, and the selected headphone-monitor source. `[D]` indicates that DVS is enabled for the assigned input channel.
